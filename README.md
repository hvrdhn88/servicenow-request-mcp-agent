# 🤖 ServiceNow MCP Agent

**A local AI Agent that connects Claude Desktop directly to your ServiceNow instance.**

Unlike a standard chatbot, this agent uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to give Claude "hands." It can inspect forms, look up user IDs, and submit live orders to your instance—all from your local machine.

1. **Python 3.10+** installed.
2. The **[Claude Desktop App](https://claude.ai/download)** installed.
3. A **ServiceNow Developer Instance** (or any instance with API access).
